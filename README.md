# Not a chess game

This Java app uses a standard chess board and pieces, but with new rules. The goal in this game is to lose all your pieces. If all of your pieces are captured in less then 50 moves, you win; If both players have made 50 moves, the player with the fewest pieces left wins.

### Game modes
> - Human vs Human: After compiling the notchess.java file (the rest will be automatically compiled), you can run it as java com.github.frensi.notchess.notchess H to play agains another human.
> - Human vs Computer: By running the app as java com.github.frensi.notchess.notchess C, you will be able to play against the computer. The computer moves are randomized while also following the rules.
> - Server mode: You can create a server so that other users can connect to you and play against your computer. The server moves are played by the computer. You can run it as java com.github.frensi.notchess.notchess S to create the server.
> - Client mode: You can create a client and connect to a server and play against it. The client moves are made by the computer. You can run it as java com.github.frensi.notchess.notchess T followed by the IP of the server (127.0.0.1 to play in localhost).

### This project helped me learn and practice:
> - Java packages to maintain a clean and modular code structure
> - Networking with TCP to enable playing the game over the network.
> - Creating Java GUI by using AWT and Swing libraries.
> - Object oriented programming and data structures
